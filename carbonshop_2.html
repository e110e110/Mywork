                                <p>Can the purchase decisions you make every day at the grocery store truly impact the environment? Greenhouse gas emissions from the grocery industry associated with agriculture, shipping, and food processing and storage truly are a good proxy for many environmental issues. However, few grocery shopping platforms inform and encourage users to make green purchasing decisions. 
                                </br><b>In order to make everyday green purchase decisions easier than ever, we designed a mobile application that includes data on the carbon emissions of common grocery items as well as a financial incentive program that rewards eco-friendly choices.</b></p>

                                According to research, to prevent the worst effects of climate change, CO2 emissions would need to reach Net Zero by 2050. Although today’s people have started raising their awareness of saving carbon emissions and protecting the environment, many of them are still confused about starting from small actions in their daily lives, for example, grocery shopping. 
                                Currently, the average annual carbon footprint from food for a person in the United States is 2 tons, equivalent to the carbon sequestered by 7.9 acres of U.S. forests in a year. As a result, it will take 2.6 billion acres of American forests per year to sequester the entire annual CO2 emission from food for all Americans.<br/> <b>People are unaware that their grocery-store purchases have a significant environmental impact.</b></p><br/>

        <ul>
            <li>Direct competitors are products that also encourage people to shop in an environmentally friendly way.</li><br/>
            <li>Indirect competitors are products that assist people in developing an environmentally friendly lifestyle but do not have a direct link to shopping.</li><br/>

            <!--   <ul>
                    <li><b>Goal Setting At Initial Stage is Good</b><br/>Setting goals can help users stick to low-carbon activities, and because everyone's lifestyle is different, a customized goal can help users achieve their goal reasonably.
                    </li><br/>
                    <li><b>Visualizing Impacts on The Environment is Good</b><br/>Users can get feedback on the impact of their activities by visualizing environmental impacts. They can also check to see if they're on track.
                    </li><br/>
                    <li><b>Rewards and Incentives are Good</b><br/>Users can be encouraged to participate in these low-carbon activities through the Rewards and Incentives mechanism. Users can, for example, exchange their reward for gift cards or donate their reward to a non-profit that plants trees.

                    <li> Shop is one of our main navigation because users need to see product information when shopping. Users can browse different products or search for specific products while shopping.

Users can receive green points if their order has a lower carbon emissions.

We set up a main scenario with different tasks with post-task questions to test if there are any usability issues we need to fix. We received both qualitative responses and quantitative data from the participants. 
                                                                        If users thought the tasks were simple, they would give them a score of 5. This app's overall score is 4.5/5.0, indicating that it is simple and intuitive to use.

We explored what forms of presenting carbon emissions can be the most accessible, intuitive and user-centered way for user experience. Also, we spent a lot of time on considering what types of visualization would motivate users best and to help them  understand their contributions effectively.

Also, it was interesting to find out people have different interpretations and understanding of carbon emissions and possible incentives. Therefore, it is important to think about motivating them in different ways.

One the one hand, we would like to utilize eco-points as an incentive and gamifications to keep users continually engaging in green shopping; one the other hand, as a green application, we aim not to encourage users to do extra purchases apart from essential daily grocery items as it would conflict our product vision - producing more carbon emissions. Thus, one lesson we learnt from this phrase is to achieve a balance between benefits from different perspectives.
