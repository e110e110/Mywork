Therefore, <b>we designed a mobile application that makes everyday green purchase decisions easier than ever</b>, with diverse environmental metrics for everyday grocery consumer products and a financial incentive program that rewards green purchase decisions.

        <ul>
            <li><b>Direct competitors</b> are products that also encourage people to shop in an environmentally friendly way.</li><br/>

                    </li><br/>
                    <li><b>Visualizing Impacts on The Environment is Good</b><br/>Users can get feedback on the impact of their activities by visualizing environmental impacts. They can also check to see if they're on track.
                    </li><br/>
                    <li><b>Rewards and Incentives are Good</b><br/>Users can be encouraged to participate in these low-carbon activities through the Rewards and Incentives mechanism. Users can, for example, exchange their reward for gift cards or donate their reward to a non-profit that plants trees.
                    </li><br/>
                    <li><b>Limited Stores Can Be Improved</b><br/>Although there is now one direct competitor with a reward system, users can only shop from a limited number of stores, and it is not linked to the user's existing shopping stores.</li><br/>
                    <li><b>Gamification Can Be Improved</b><br/>All of our direct competitors currently lack gamifications, but we've learned from indirect competitors that gamifications can help users engage in these low-carbon activities more joyfully and establish a habit.</li>

            <p>According to our user interviews, we made a user journey map of daily online grocery shopping experiences to further find out pain points and improvement opportunities in this process. 
                Stages of this online grocery shopping includes: 
                <ul>
                    <li>	Consider what grocery products</li>
                        <li>Choose which applications/websites to use</li>
                            <li>	Search for specific items</li>
                                <li>Compare and evaluate </li>
                                    <li>Checkout</li>

                            Prices are one of the main determinants while doing grocery shopping. Also, specific rewards, including discounts, free samples, and participating in green funds, can greatly attract people to buy green groceries.

                        <li><b>	People find it hard to understand the importance of a low-carbon lifestyle.</b><br/>
                            People did not purchase green products as they could not receive instant benefits through their decisions. However, current products lack carbon footprint information, and people have no idea about potential impacts.

                        <li><b>	People need approachable and engaging ways to participate in a low-carbon lifestyle.</b><br/>
                            People express interests if the platform can provide an attractive way of having them join in. Also, raising awareness of environmental issues is a serious topic, and there should be approachable ways for them to understand and engage in relevant activities.

                    <br/><br/>
                <p>  Then, we came up with three design strategies to address user’s pain points in green shopping:

                <!--  <ul>
                        <li><b>Reward mechanism that prompts users to get green purchasing habits.</b><br/>
                            Getting green points and redeeming free samples give users financial incentives. Also, the gamification feature of planting virtual forests can encourage users to continuously participate in green activities since they can feel a sense of reward by joining in forest infrastructure and management.
                       
                        </li>
                        <li><b>		Visualize the green purchase process and impact on each step.</b><br/>
                            According to our user research, we found that people lack carbon footprint information to help them compare different products during shopping. We want to provide users with carbon emission information of each product to help them consider carbon footprint when shopping. Visualization of carbon footprint data among many grocery products and recommendations of other similar products with higher environment scores can help users understand the potential impacts of buying specific products.
                   
                        </li>
                        <li><b>	Customize the experience to set up different environmental goals.</b><br/>
                            Users will be asked to evaluate their shopping behaviors and goals during the onboarding stage. The app will provide suggestions based on their feedback. Users can also check their progress in the profile section by summarizing their purchasing and redeeming activities so far.

                    <li>Firstly, our application displays the users' accomplishments on the homepage to remind them of the impact they have had. Users may shop in different stores, so we integrated these stores into the homepage to help users to shop.
                    </li>  
                    <li> Shop is one of our main navigation because users need to see product information when shopping. Users can browse different products or search for specific products while shopping.
                    </li> 
                    <li> In users’ shopping carts, to draw users' attention to their impact on the environment, we will present customers with information on how much carbon emissions have been cut by their order this time compared to typical purchasing. Users can receive green points if their order has a lower carbon emissions.
                    </li> 
                    <li>  To encourage people who are unconcerned about the environment to consider green shopping, reward plays an important role in motivating consumers to buy low-carbon goods. Users can see their environmental impact on this reward page and redeem their green points for trees or green products.
                    </li> 
                    <li>   In the profile page, users can see their order history and their impact on the environment to summarize their purchases.</li>

                        We used paper and pens to brainstorm and sketch our ideas individually, and we critiqued our initial designs together to define main features. Then we used Figma to implement our wireframes.    
                        We sketched four main pages for our app, including Home page, Search page, Product description page and Check out the page.

Therefore, we decided to use a variety of green shades as our color palette. Our high-fidelity mockup mainly utilizes green and white colors to emphasize the concept of sustainability, nature, and health. </P>

Through our four rounds of user testing and iterations, we learned a lot from users’ feedback and managed to design for better user flow and achieve the product goal at the same time.
                                                                            </li>

Also, we faced challenges regarding labeling products with carbon footprints and how to explain to users about our virtual points for redeeming purposes. Since one of our strategies is to inform users clearly about their potential impacts, we need to choose words carefully to avoid misinterpretation.
                                                                            </li>

                                                                                We found out that some users prefer to spend points to redeem goods, while others prefer to use points to redeem games. Also, it was interesting to find out people have different interpretations and understanding of carbon emissions and possible incentives. Therefore, it is important to think about motivating them in different ways.
                                                                            </li>
