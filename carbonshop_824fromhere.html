                                <p>The average annual carbon footprint from food for a person in the United States is 2 tons, equivalent to the carbon sequestered by 110 tree seedlings grown for 10 years. However, few grocery shopping platforms inform and encourage users to make green purchasing decisions. Therefore, <b>we designed a mobile application that makes everyday green purchase decisions easier than ever</b>, with diverse environmental metrics for everyday grocery consumer products and a financial incentive program that rewards green purchase decisions.

        <p>We conducted 11 user interviews during the discovery phase of this project to gain a better understanding of users' grocery shopping habits. We mainly exploring what are the main determinants of their daily grocery shopping, what factors preventing them from buying environment-friendly products, and what possible incentives can be used to engage them into making more green decisions in their grocery shopping process. </p>   
        
        
        <p>According to our user interviews, we made a user journey map of daily online grocery shopping experiences to further find out pain points and improvement opportunities in this process. 
            Stages of this online grocery shopping includes: 
            <ul>
                <li>	Consider what grocery products</li>
                    <li>Choose which applications/websites to use</li>
                        <li>	Search for specific items</li>
                            <li>Compare and evaluate </li>
                                <li>Checkout</li>

               <br/>
                <p>  After analyzing our user research findings, we decided to concentrate on these three pain points because they will influence the users' green decision.
     
                   
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>People are unaware of the consequences of their carbon footprint.</b><br/>
                            People felt hard to see big impacts from their small actions. They did not purchase green products as they could not receive instant benefits through their decisions. Current products lack carbon footprint information, and people have no idea about potential impacts. 
                   
                        </li>
                        <li><b>	People need approachable and engaging ways to participate in a low-carbon lifestyle.</b><br/>
                            People express interests if the platform can provide an attractive way of having them join in. Also, raising awareness of environmental issues is a serious topic, and there should be approachable ways for them to understand and engage in relevant activities.
                     
                        </li>
                        <li><b>People can be encouraged to go grocery shopping with rewards.</b><br/>
                            Prices are one of the main determinants while doing grocery shopping. Also, specific rewards, including discounts, free samples, and participating in green funds, can greatly attract people to buy green groceries.

                        <li><b>Reward mechanism that prompts users to get green purchasing habits.</b><br/>
                            Getting green points and redeeming free samples give users financial incentives. Also, the gamification feature of planting virtual forests can encourage users to continuously participate in green activities since they can feel a sense of reward by joining in forest infrastructure and management.

                            According to our user research, we found that people lack carbon footprint information to help them compare different products during shopping. We want to provide users with carbon emission information of each product to help them consider carbon footprint when shopping. Visualization of carbon footprint data among many grocery products and recommendations of other similar products with higher environment scores can help users understand the potential impacts of buying specific products.

                            Users will be asked to evaluate their shopping behaviors and goals during the onboarding stage. The app will provide suggestions based on their feedback. Users can also check their progress in the profile section by summarizing their purchasing and redeeming activities so far.

            <p>With our design strategies, we started to create the information architecture.<br/>

                <p>Rationale:<br/>
                <ul>  
                    <li>Firstly, our application displays the users' accomplishments on the homepage to remind them of the impact they have had. Users may shop in different stores, so we integrated these stores into the homepage to help users to shop.
                    </li>  
                    <li> Shop is one of our main navigation because users need to see product information when shopping. Users can browse different products or search for specific products while shopping.
                    </li> 
                    <li> In users’ shopping carts, to draw users' attention to their impact on the environment, we will present customers with information on how much carbon emissions have been cut by their order this time compared to typical purchasing. Users can receive green points if their order has a lower carbon emissions.
                    </li> 
                    <li>  To encourage people who are unconcerned about the environment to consider green shopping, reward plays an important role in motivating consumers to buy low-carbon goods. Users can see their environmental impact on this reward page and redeem their green points for trees or green products.
                    </li> 
                    <li>   In the profile page, users can see their order history and their impact on the environment to summarize their purchases.</li>

                        We used paper and pens to brainstorm and sketch our ideas individually, and we critiqued our initial designs together to define main features. Then we used Figma to implement our wireframes.    
                        We sketched four main pages for our app, including Home page, Search page, Product description page and Check out the page.

                    <p>To gather our findings for further inspiration in both wireframing and high-fidelity prototyping, we created a moodboard.<br/>

                        Based on the moodboard above, we created a style tile. We found there is an agreement that most designs use green colors as well as plant icons to illustrate the sense of environment and ecosystem. Therefore, we decided to use a variety of green shades as our color palette. Our high-fidelity mockup mainly utilizes green and white colors to emphasize the concept of sustainability, nature, and health. </P>

                                        For the Hi-fi prototype, we designed pages for main flows including “homepage and product listing page” for users to search products and add to their carts, “product description”, “check-out and replacement product”, “profile”, “redeem and my forest page” - which covers most of sections on our application to make further user test sessions easier and accurate.
